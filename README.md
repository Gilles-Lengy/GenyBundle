# GenyBundle

Goal of this bundle is to provide:
- a user interface to create forms
- a user interface to render and validate those forms

# WARNING: under development! POCs, etc.

## What is it?

There are tons of ideas where admin may need to draw a form, set a template (not necessarily a view) and then final user can give the context by filling the form.
This way, user's context is mixed to admin's template and, according to a website's goal, do some stuff without any programming needs.

Some websites examples:
- a highly-dynamic back end: admin define sql query/linux command templates and the context form: and users can run those query/commands after filling that form.
- a code generator: user define templates and forms to complete the context, and then just need to fill it as much times as he want.
